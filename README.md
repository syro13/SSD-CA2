This is a website where I show certain speedrunners, their respective games and info about each of their runs.

## Navigation Bar

There is a simple navbar with 3 options with the website name bringing you to the home page

### Option 1 - Form

Here you will be able to fill out a psuedo form to add a run to the leaderboard.
This of course won't work since a real run would have to be validated by a real person to ensure the run wasn't cheated

### Option 2 - Runners

Here you will find each runner and their distinct profile pictures/logos

### Option 3 - Games

Here you will find each of the games that the runners have a record in.

## Data

Each piece of data is displayed in cards which a responsive when the site changes from desktop to mobile
